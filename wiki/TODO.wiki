== Handicap calculation and evaluation ==

Goals:
  * Calculate handicap for user when opening new game
  * Handicap should be based on log entries
  * Adjust game settings to user handicap (i.e., increased level of difficulty for skilled users)

Considerations:
  * Generic interface for all games; each game will must implement a method for calculating the handicap and for adjusting the game settings
  * Normalized handicap value for all games (e.g. a value between 0.0 and 1.0 where 0.0 is the best possible and 1.0 the worst possible value)

Open questions:
  * Rely on order of log IDs to determine which log entries belong to one game?
  * Only use results for single player games (user vs. NPC)?
  * Default handicap value?
  * For the numberline game:
     * How does a suitable mapping of handicap value to pointer width look like? 

== Logging == 

Consider new table game_properties. A log entry will refer to this table via a foreign key constraint. This would allow for determining which users took part in one specific game.
